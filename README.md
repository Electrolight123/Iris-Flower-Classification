# Iris-Flower-Classification
This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into different species using a neural network model. The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which contains various attributes of Iris flowers such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species.

# Dataset Description
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). For this classification project, we use features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to predict the species of Iris flower.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different features. Various visualizations such as box plots, scatter plots, pair plots, and categorical plots are used to explore the data and identify patterns.

# Neural Network Model
The neural network model is implemented using Keras, a high-level neural networks API. The model architecture consists of multiple layers of densely connected neurons. The final layer uses the softmax activation function for multi-class classification. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
